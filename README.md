This project delves into analyzing Row Health's data using SQL to gain valuable insights into its operations, customer base, and overall performance.

I used SQL queries [here](https://github.com/wzhang0194/Row-Health-SQL-Project/blob/main/Row_Health_SQL_Queries.sql) to analyze and summarize the insights below, to be delivered to the finance, product, and marketing teams.

# Recommendations
Based on these insights, the team would like to make several recommendations across several areas:

* **Product:**
    * Bundle and Subscription Offers: Consider offering bundled packages or subscription plans for these hair products to incentivize customers to purchase multiple products or subscribe for recurring shipments. This can foster customer loyalty and increase the average customer lifetime value.

 * **Marketing:**
     * Enhance Silver Plan Benefits: Since the silver plan has proven to be the most popular, consider further enhancing its benefits and coverage to attract more customers. Conduct market research to identify areas of improvement and add value-added services that align with customers' needs and preferences.
            
 * **Christmas Time Period:**
     * Educate about Biotin Benefits: Since there were no claims for Biotin supplements during the observed periods, create educational content and informative materials that emphasize the benefits of Biotin for hair, skin, and nail health. Use social media, blog posts, and customer testimonials to raise awareness about the advantages of Biotin supplements.
